# spring-boot-activiti-demo

## About

This is a simple project showing examples using Spring-Boot and Activiti BPMN. It will be using Activiti Community not 
enterprise so you will need some form of plugin to be able to play with the Activiti BPMN workflow.

## Pre-requisites

* You will need to have a database (relational or non relational. I used a relational for this example)
and create a database called `activiti-demo`. Before you start up the application.
* To start up the  application you will just run `mvn spring-boot:run`.____
